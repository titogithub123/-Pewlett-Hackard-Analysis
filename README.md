# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### Helping Prepare for the Silver Tsunami
The purpose of the analysis is to determine which employees at Pewlett-Hackard are coming upon retiring age by using SQL queries in our relational database. Also, we will be looking at which employees are within our determined framwork for Mentorship Eligibiltiy.

## Results
Given our analysis, we are able to determine quite a bit of information when it comes to the number of employees reaching retirment age and also, those who are ready for mentorship eligibilty. At a glance we can see which employees fit the critera we set as being ready to retire. This provides us a treasure trove of practical insight that will help us prepare for the upcoming silver tsunami of baby boomers who are reaching retirement age. 

By taking this data and analyzing it we can be better prepared and equiped to meet the upcoming inevitablilty of thousands of employees no longer being part of the company. For example we can...

- (1) See the individual employees who fit the critera of being born between Januray 1st, 1952 to December 31, 1955.
- (2) Determine a count of how many employees are reaching retirement age by department
- (3) Help us prepare our hiring metrics to make sure we fill the roles where they are most needed in the departments where we will lose employees.

Additionaly, we are also able to...

- (4) Calculate who fits the critera and is available to participate in our Mentorship Eligibiltiy program.
